## Unit 3 Capstone -- Predicting whether or not a movie is "good". 
I've been a movie fanatic since I was a kid and have quite a wealth of movie trivia knowledge. My mentor (Artem Yankov) pointed me to this dataset on Kaggle as a suggestion for this capstone, in which I will be predicting whether or not a movie is "good" based on its IMDb score. Generally a movie with an IMDb rating of 7.0 or higher is considered good. This dataset covers over 5000 movies from across the globe, with over 100 years worth of movie data.
