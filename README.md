## My Portfolio

This is a collection of capstone projects that I completed during the Thinkful Data Science course:

1. Galaxy Image Classification--using neural networks with images of galaxies to predict galaxy types and features
2. Movie Score Prediction--using supervised ML to predict if a movie has a "good" IMDb score
