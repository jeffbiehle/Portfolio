## My Portfolio

This is a collection of capstone projects that I completed during the Thinkful Data Science program as well as supplemental projects I'm working on:

1. Galaxy Image Classification--implemented neural networks with images of galaxies to predict galaxy types and features
2. Movie Score Prediction--implemented supervised ML on a Kaggle movie data set to predict if a movie has a "good" IMDb score
3. Walmart Store Comparison--exploration on Walmart store data to set up a hypothetical TV ad campaign
